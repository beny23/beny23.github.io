The conference didn&amp;rsquo;t actually start on Tuesday, there was a little session on Monday as people were trickling in from all over the world. And in said session, Gene presented his latest project. He was writing a book with Steven Spears called Wiring the Winning Organisation.
If I&amp;rsquo;m honest, I am not a fan of the title.</description></item></channel></rss>
