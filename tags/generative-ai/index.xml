Want. To. Scream. Not so long ago, I reviewed about 1,000 CVs (resumes). 500 for a frontend developer position, about 500 for a backend developer position. You might think I was crazy, why don&amp;rsquo;t I let an agency do the sifting for me? Well, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the thing that made me scream.
I spearheaded an initiative to reduce the TCO by 10.35%
Or some such drivel. &amp;ldquo;Spearheading&amp;rdquo;. What is it with that word?</description></item><item><title>DevOpsDays Amsterdam 2024</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/devopsdays_amsterdam_2024/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/devopsdays_amsterdam_2024/</guid><description>Once again, I&amp;rsquo;m sat at Schipol Airport typing up my thoughts about a few days of refreshing Dutch DevOps Goodness! Ok, I admit one or five alcoholic beverages might have been involved too. This was my first DevOpsDays and it did not disappoint.
My day started at 3am to catch a flight at 6am but because I was still awake at 1:30 and had decided sleep is for wimps, I arrived a little bit wired.</description></item><item><title>Recall: the Amazonification of Office Work</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/recall_enshittification/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/recall_enshittification/</guid><description>Following a quip on LinkedIn about the introduction of Recall in Copilot+ and Kevin Beaumont&amp;rsquo;s great piece about why this is a really bad idea from a security point of view, I got thinking:
This is dystopian techno-fascism
Kevin posited a disconnect in Microsoft that led to the creation of this feature and whether people really wanted it. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a brain like a sieve and would not know the command line without ~/.</description></item><item><title>AI-dvent of Code 2023: Day 4</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_4_ai_experiments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_4_ai_experiments/</guid><description>After the glimmer of hope on day 3 I was quite optimistic for the day 4 puzzle. I kept going with the phind-codellama model. I continued with keeping the model on a fairly tight leash and just being very specific as to what I wanted it to do.
What&amp;rsquo;s the puzzle? So, for the first part, we had to parse a text file and then match up numbers and winning numbers.</description></item><item><title>AI-dvent of Code 2023: Day 3</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_3_ai_experiments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_3_ai_experiments/</guid><description>My experimentation with LLMs on day 1 and day 2 of Advent of Code was a bit frustrating. For the day 3 puzzle, I decided to change model. Previously I had been using the codellama:13b model but wasn&amp;rsquo;t really happy. I kept arguing with it and it just frustrated me. So let&amp;rsquo;s try some others.
codellama:34b So I thought maybe the model just wasn&amp;rsquo;t big enough, so off we went</description></item><item><title>AI-dvent of Code 2023: Day 2</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_2_ai_experiments/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_2_ai_experiments/</guid><description>After day 1 of Advent of Code was only partially successful, I thought I would change my approach. Yesterday I tried to get the LLM to develop the whole solution in one go. But that was more like argumentative programming rather than conversational programming, so for the day 2 puzzle I start with small problems and hope to put it all together at the end.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started The problem looked quite straightforward, parse something like the following</description></item><item><title>AI-dvent of Code 2023: Day 1</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_1_ai_experiments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_1_ai_experiments/</guid><description>So it is that time of the year again. Advent of Code is back. Yey! This means I get to try to look at a new language again. This time, why not Kotlin? But as an extra challenge, I thought why not see how the vaunted LLMs would help. Is AI really the accelerator that would elevate a mere developer to a rockstar ninja (whatever that is)?
I have to add that I am a bit of an AI sceptic and keep saying that</description></item><item><title>DevOps Enterprise Summit - simple paper cranes</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/devops_enterprise_summit_2023_tuesday/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/devops_enterprise_summit_2023_tuesday/</guid><description>As I am sitting on the 16th floor of the Okura Hotel in Amsterdam in my Batman pyjamas and facing a large mirror, just glimpsing the paper crane that was so lovingly put on my pillow, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to reflect what has happened during the day. I was lucky enough to be a guest at the DevOps Enterprise Summit. There was certainly plenty of things to get excited about.
I&amp;rsquo;d meet Gene Kim, who&amp;rsquo;s been running this conference for 10 years and who wrote the Phoenix Project.</description></item><item><title>ApocalypsAI: Skynet not needed</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/apocalyps_ai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/apocalyps_ai/</guid><description>FADE IN: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY Opay and Bart are sitting in a dimly lit room, surrounded by stacks of old newspapers and books. OPAY: (sighing) It's not their fault. They don't understand the meaning behind the words. BART: (confused) What do you mean? OPAY: (explaining) The machines were programmed to generate content based on keywords and patterns, not on the actual meaning of the words. BART: (realizing) So they just keep churning out more and more content, without any understanding of what it means.</description></item></channel></rss>
