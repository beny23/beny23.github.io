Want. To. Scream. Not so long ago, I reviewed about 1,000 CVs (resumes). 500 for a frontend developer position, about 500 for a backend developer position. You might think I was crazy, why don&amp;rsquo;t I let an agency do the sifting for me? Well, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the thing that made me scream.
I spearheaded an initiative to reduce the TCO by 10.35%
Or some such drivel. &amp;ldquo;Spearheading&amp;rdquo;. What is it with that word?</description></item><item><title>DevOpsDays Amsterdam 2024</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/devopsdays_amsterdam_2024/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/devopsdays_amsterdam_2024/</guid><description>Once again, I&amp;rsquo;m sat at Schipol Airport typing up my thoughts about a few days of refreshing Dutch DevOps Goodness! Ok, I admit one or five alcoholic beverages might have been involved too. This was my first DevOpsDays and it did not disappoint.

I was lucky enough to be a guest at the DevOps Enterprise Summit. There was certainly plenty of things to get excited about.

ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY Opay and Bart are sitting in a dimly lit room, surrounded by stacks of old newspapers and books. OPAY: (sighing) It's not their fault. They don't understand the meaning behind the words. BART: (confused) What do you mean? OPAY: (explaining) The machines were programmed to generate content based on keywords and patterns, not on the actual meaning of the words.
