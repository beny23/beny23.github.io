The latest in the 4shell family of vulnerabilities. What does 4shell mean? Usually that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to do RCE (Remote Code Execution) based on an application vulnerability and typically, attackers will leverage that to get a remote shell.
And now, for something completely different My first link is not related to react4shell, but it&amp;rsquo;s yet another way of how guardrails in LLM models can be subverted.</description></item><item><title>Weakly Link 25/48</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/weakly_link_2025_48/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/weakly_link_2025_48/</guid><description>This week is an odd mixture about sandworms, supply chains and basically how everything is broken anyway. And then (after all the naughtiness) let&amp;rsquo;s end on something nice.
Thumped by a Sandworm Sha1 Hulud came back for another go at supply chain attacks. Patient zero of this wave appears to have been Posthog - an analytics platform a bit like Mixpanel. According to their postmortem, their build pipeline was compromised by a simple pull request.</description></item><item><title>Weakly Link 25/47</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/weakly_link_2025_47/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/weakly_link_2025_47/</guid><description>This week there have been some interesting bugs. Or interest in bugs.
Bugs It was Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s turn to break the internet. As per usual, the transparency on display is rather cool. It was rather interesting that for once, the problem wasn&amp;rsquo;t DNS or BGP, neither was it a cyberattack. Though indirectly, the threat of bots was responsible. As a subtle change in the handling of queries meant that the bot management system suddenly produced config files that were twice as large and that made them larger than the system could handle.</description></item><item><title>Weakly Link 25/46</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/weakly_link_2025_46/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/weakly_link_2025_46/</guid><description>This week&amp;rsquo;s edition of the weakly link has got some fire in it:
First on the menu we&amp;rsquo;ve got a report that tries to tell us that if there&amp;rsquo;s an AI bubble, that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing: The AI Wildfire Is Coming. It&amp;rsquo;s Going to Be Very Painful and Incredibly Healthy Instead of a bubble, the post tells us of one dinner guest at a CEO dinner in Silicon Valley who argues that instead of a bubble it is more like a wildfire.</description></item><item><title>Weakly Link 25/45</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/weakly_link_2025_45/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/weakly_link_2025_45/</guid><description>Every week I come across some interesting, ridiculous or astounding content related to security and tech around software engineering. And I post it on the company Slack, sometimes on LinkedIn and often on BlueSky or Mastodon. (I deleted my Twitter account a long time ago. No Nazi bar for me.)
And yet, I often forget all about the content. And because I closed my browser with 200ish open tabs once too often, I thought, why not write about the things that interested me, then I can look back on them and maybe someone else might find them interesting too.</description></item></channel></rss>
