Now, if you&amp;rsquo;ve never been to a BSides - and I had only been to one prior - then hopefully this gives you a bit of a feel as to what to expect. In short, there&amp;rsquo;s lots of interesting people with great talks and insights and something that feels just right. A bit of community and some weird people.</description></item></channel></rss>
