I got up early in the morning for a road trip from Preston to Newcastle, and setting off at 5:30 on Saturday turned out to be atmospheric and straightforward. So I was a bit early and got a glimpse of the chaos that is putting together a BSides. Later I found out that BSides Newcastle was traditionally more chaotic than some of the other BSides.</description></item><item><title>BSides Leeds 2023: Get the basics right</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/bsides_leeds_2023/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/bsides_leeds_2023/</guid><description>It is a couple of weeks after my trip to Leeds to go speak at BSides. Now, if you&amp;rsquo;ve never been to a BSides - and I had only been to one prior - then hopefully this gives you a bit of a feel as to what to expect. In short, there&amp;rsquo;s lots of interesting people with great talks and insights and something that feels just right. A bit of community and some weird people.</description></item></channel></rss>
