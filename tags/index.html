44CON 2023: It takes a Village

</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
As I stare at my laptop after an intense few days at 44CON, I reflect on the experience. I went through a lot of different emotions. Excitement, trepidation, relief, bewilderment, pride, disappointment and hope had accompanied my visit to London to 44CON. We had an OSINT Capture The Flag competition happen right next to a round-table discussion on how the government should secure the country. Looking from outside in, a rallying cry of &ldquo;Hack the Planet&rdquo; (if you want to feel old, it turned 28 during the con) side-by-side with the establishment might not be the first thing to expect at a security conference.

AI-dvent of Code 2023: Day 4

</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
After the glimmer of hope on day 3 I was quite optimistic for the day 4 puzzle. I kept going with the phind-codellama model. I continued with keeping the model on a fairly tight leash and just being very specific as to what I wanted it to do.
What&rsquo;s the puzzle? So, for the first part, we had to parse a text file and then match up numbers and winning numbers.

My experimentation with LLMs on day 1 and day 2 of Advent of Code was a bit frustrating. For the day 3 puzzle, I decided to change model. Previously I had been using the codellama:13b model but wasn&rsquo;t really happy. I kept arguing with it and it just frustrated me. So let&rsquo;s try some others.
codellama:34b So I thought maybe the model just wasn&rsquo;t big enough, so off we went

After day 1 of Advent of Code was only partially successful, I thought I would change my approach. Yesterday I tried to get the LLM to develop the whole solution in one go.

Day 22 of Advent of Code 2021 was all about cubes. The problem statement provided us with coordinates of cubes and an &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off&rdquo; instructions. These instructions needed to be carried out in order. The first part of the problem was deceptively simple. So much so that I didn&rsquo;t go for the &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; solution initially because I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t scale. As it happened I ended up implementing it anyway as my optimised approach wasn&rsquo;t working because I made a simple mistake.

Day 18 of Advent of Code 2021 took rather a long time to get right. Half of the problem was that there were a couple of gotchas in the requirements and the choice of data structure hugely impacted how easy it was to come up with a solution. Just like Day 17 I was using TDD and this helped me root out some blind alleys nicely.

On day 17 of Advent of Code 2021, I did something that I should have really done from the start: Write tests first. My excuse so far has been that I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with Haskell yet and other such lame excuses. As a software engineer, I should know better. TDD doesn&rsquo;t slow me down, it makes things faster. The last straw - if you like - was when I was writing up my exploits from Day 16 and I thought there really is no excuse for not testing these parser combinators individually.

According to the story, we had to decode a message in a custom binary format, the Buoyancy Interchange Transmission System (BITS). BITS is a message format that encodes both literal values and operations.

The DevOps Enterprise Summit 2023 has exceeded my expectations. But before I get to there, I&rsquo;d just like to develop the airport metaphor a little bit. So here I am, looking at culture.
Why was it that at Schipol, one of the busiest airports in the world, it was a breeze to get through security, airport security agents were smiling, cracking jokes, I could leave my laptop, toothpaste and deodorant in the bag and they have art in the middle of the airport, goddammit.

As I am sitting on the 16th floor of the Okura Hotel in Amsterdam in my Batman pyjamas and facing a large mirror, just glimpsing the paper crane that was so lovingly put on my pillow, I&rsquo;m starting to reflect what has happened during the day. I was lucky enough to be a guest at the DevOps Enterprise Summit. There was certainly plenty of things to get excited about.
I&rsquo;d meet Gene Kim, who&rsquo;s been running this conference for 10 years and who wrote the Phoenix Project.

&ldquo;Outdated tech stack and metaphorical gaffer tape holding together the code&rdquo; - sound familiar? How about &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t recruit, because nobody wants to touch this legacy stuff&rdquo;? Yet banks and governments would stop working if mainframes were switched off.
Instead of outsourcing to the lowest bidder, maintenance is a job for experienced engineers. Not &ldquo;the short straw&rdquo;, brown field development can be more exciting than a feature factory. After all, the shiny code written today is the legacy code of tomorrow&mldr;

Let me tell you a story about Application Security (AppSec). It contains heroes and villains, and I&rsquo;m not necessarily thinking about the defenders and attackers here. It contains lots of interesting technology that is often overemphasised. We&rsquo;ve got whole industries that work on letting us know how scary it is out there, vulnerabilities that are marketed like rock stars and terminology that makes you quiver in your boots: who would want to fall victim to an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?

No, no, and NO! Crypto is a scourge that wastes energy, kills the planet and destroys lives, no-code and low code will mean some actual software engineers will have to pick up the pieces when it inevitably will go wrong and the metaverse (second second life) looks to be a great way to make the web as tedious to use than going to an actual shop where you can&rsquo;t find anything because the items have moved to another shelf yet again.

Dave Farley and Allen Holub are two people that I respect hugely when it comes to Software Development.

So when both came together for Dave&rsquo;s Engineering Room (sponsored by Equal Experts, who I work with), it was bound to be very interesting.
In this post I try to outline my key takeaways from watching the chat.

I was really positively and pleasantly surprised when I found out what HMRC Digital&rsquo;s mission statement was.
Normally, I am not a fan of mission statements. They usually read like this:
Our mission is focused on six core aspirations the company continually strives to achieve&mldr;
Or some such drivel. Verbal gymnastics to make a company sound like everything to everyone - without being offensive to anyone - which then gets used to &ldquo;align&rdquo; people on mandated fun days.

In this post, I am going to look at an increasingly important part of securing applications: Your supply chain. This includes every library, tool or service that you are using to build, run and monitor your service.
When the log4shell vulnerability hit, it wasn&rsquo;t just a matter of looking at the dependencies that your source code pulls in, but also at the infrastructure you&rsquo;re using and the build pipeline.
Have you had a look at the vulnerability reports of your dependencies lately?

A few days back as part of a general discussion about interviewing at Equal Experts, we looked at the question &ldquo;What makes a good developer?&rdquo; Could we come up with a list of qualities in a developer that we&rsquo;d want to look for? This post illustrates my thinking.
Why do you ask? To put it in a bit of context, I&rsquo;m a software developer, I&rsquo;m not a recruiter, but I&rsquo;ve been involved with technical interviewing for quite a while, and have marked a fair number of take-home tests over the years, but recently we thought that the experience was not as good as it could be.

Dave Farley and Martin Fowler are two heavyweights when it comes to Software Development.

All of which are hugely influential to large swathes of software engineers.

Wouldn&rsquo;t it be useful to record the session and make it available? Now, this piece of writing does not explore whether we should be recording meetings, nor does it attempt to answer the question of whether good documentation wouldn&rsquo;t be preferable to having to sit and spend hours watching someone droning on about something that could be condensed into a five minute read of a blog post.

To successfully deliver software a developer needs a shield and a sword.
A good product owner, delivery manager or alike that will shield the engineers from having to attend too many meetings, giving long-winded status updates and essentially allow them to get on with it. Shields go to all the meetings with the &ldquo;business&rdquo; and explain what can and cannot be done, without the engineer having to attend. A shield would also filter all the last-minute requirements or requests for gold plating without having to be dragged into endless meetings.

About two months ago I stumbled across a great YouTube video of a talk by Charity Majors called Compliance standards should be modern development practices. Now let&rsquo;s step back for a minute. Am I seriously suggesting that anything with the word &ldquo;compliance&rdquo; is going to be a riveting watch? Why, yes I am. And with good reason. I&rsquo;m a fan of good security and I like agile.

The Case Against Automatic Dependency Updates
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
The question of automatic dependency updates came up in our Slack channel the other day. There was a lot of nodding on how it is a good thing. Tools like Dependabot and Renovate were mentioned. Yet I was a dissenting voice. Why?
The case for automatic dependency updates is simple and seductive:
A bot would automatically scan your dependencies in your source code and create pull requests to update your libraries to the latest versions, sometimes even automatically merging it in.

Harvesting Logs for Fun and Profit

From a security point of view, application logs are two-sided. On the one hand, it is really important to have good observability, to find out what is happening and what has happened. On the other hand, we don&rsquo;t want to leak sensitive information. In this post I am going to look at the kinds of things you might find in your logs. The juicy bits are Personal Identifying Information (PII) or security credentials.

Why AppSec fails

Let me tell you a story about Application Security (AppSec). It contains heroes and villains, and I&rsquo;m not necessarily thinking about the defenders and attackers here. It contains lots of interesting technology that is often overemphasised. We&rsquo;ve got whole industries that work on letting us know how scary it is out there, vulnerabilities that are marketed like rock stars and terminology that makes you quiver in your boots: who would want to fall victim to an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?

Precision Munitions for Denial of Service

<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
There&rsquo;s a metaphor about the fight between attackers and defenders in the Denial of Service cybersecurity game. It&rsquo;s an &ldquo;arms race&rdquo; between ever bigger attacks throwing huge amounts of traffic at ever more sophisticated defenses (e.g. AWS shield).
Incidentally, I&rsquo;ve just demonstrated an easy mistake: I&rsquo;m not describing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, it&rsquo;s a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The aim is to overwhelm the infrastructure, either the networking infrastructure or the application by sending more requests than can be handled.

This is part of my series of interview questions for Agile India 2022.
Thinking about exciting developments in software development as a developer immediately brings magpies to mind. What is the latest technology that can grab our attention. What&rsquo;s the latest shiny? Could it be some crypto tech? Some no-code development? Or programming in the metaverse maybe?
No, no, and NO! Crypto is a scourge that wastes energy, kills the planet and destroys lives, no-code and low code will mean some actual software engineers will have to pick up the pieces when it inevitably will go wrong and the metaverse (second second life) looks to be a great way to make the web as tedious to use than going to an actual shop where you can&rsquo;t find anything because the items have moved to another shelf yet again.

There&rsquo;s a metaphor about the fight between attackers and defenders in the Denial of Service cybersecurity game. It&rsquo;s an &ldquo;arms race&rdquo; between ever bigger attacks throwing huge amounts of traffic at ever more sophisticated defenses (e.g. AWS shield).
Incidentally, I&rsquo;ve just demonstrated an easy mistake: I&rsquo;m not describing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, it&rsquo;s a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The aim is to overwhelm the infrastructure, either the networking infrastructure or the application by sending more requests than can be handled.

The question of automatic dependency updates came up in our Slack channel the other day. There was a lot of nodding on how it is a good thing. Tools like Dependabot and Renovate were mentioned. Yet I was a dissenting voice. Why?
The case for automatic dependency updates is simple and seductive:
A bot would automatically scan your dependencies in your source code and create pull requests to update your libraries to the latest versions, sometimes even automatically merging it in.

Let&rsquo;s get started The problem looked quite straightforward, parse something like the following

Advent of Code 2021 day 15 took us back to the 2-dimensional maps we first encountered on Day 11 and Day 9. We had to parse a map again, and this time we had to find the shortest path from the top left to the bottom right. This was the first time when a homespun algorithm just did not cut the mustard, and I had to wrack my brain (i.e. use Google) to do a bit of algorithm research.

After Advent of Code 2021 transparent origami on Day 13 with more output than just a number, for Day 14 it was back to more standard processing with exponential complexity. Interestingly in part 1 I initially started going down the route of not trying to brute forcing it, got almost there but tangled myself in some logic, so I decided to &ldquo;sod it, I&rsquo;ll just brute force it&rdquo; only to then throw the brute force solution away again as soon as I got to part 2.

After the glimmer of hope on day 3 I was quite optimistic for the day 4 puzzle. I kept going with the phind-codellama model. I continued with keeping the model on a fairly tight leash and just being very specific as to what I wanted it to do.

Let&rsquo;s get started The problem looked quite straightforward, parse something like the following

This was the first time when a homespun algorithm just did not cut the mustard, and I had to wrack my brain (i.e. use Google) to do a bit of algorithm research.

After Advent of Code 2021 transparent origami on Day 13 with more output than just a number, for Day 14 it was back to more standard processing with exponential complexity. Interestingly in part 1 I initially started going down the route of not trying to brute forcing it, got almost there but tangled myself in some logic, so I decided to &ldquo;sod it, I&rsquo;ll just brute force it&rdquo; only to then throw the brute force solution away again as soon as I got to part 2.

On day 13 of Advent of Code 2021 we had to do the impossible. We were folding a transparent piece of paper 12 times. Surely it isn&rsquo;t possible to fold paper more than 7 times, but we also have to remember that we&rsquo;re in a Santa submarine!
The aim of the puzzle is to get a code by folding over a transparent sheet of paper which has got dots dotted all over.

Advent of Code 2021 day 11 felt a little bit like a repeat of Day 9. In both cases, we got a 2-dimensional map with single digit values.

Once that level goes past 9, it lets off a flash, which then imparts extra energy into the surrounding 8-legged creatures.

A few days back as part of a general discussion about interviewing at Equal Experts, we looked at the question &ldquo;What makes a good developer?&rdquo; Could we come up with a list of qualities in a developer that we&rsquo;d want to look for? This post illustrates my thinking.
Why do you ask? To put it in a bit of context, I&rsquo;m a software developer, I&rsquo;m not a recruiter, but I&rsquo;ve been involved with technical interviewing for quite a while, and have marked a fair number of take-home tests over the years, but recently we thought that the experience was not as good as it could be.

After the glimmer of hope on day 3 I was quite optimistic for the day 4 puzzle. I kept going with the phind-codellama model. I continued with keeping the model on a fairly tight leash and just being very specific as to what I wanted it to do.
What&rsquo;s the puzzle? So, for the first part, we had to parse a text file and then match up numbers and winning numbers.

Let&rsquo;s get started The problem looked quite straightforward, parse something like the following

And in said session, Gene presented his latest project. He was writing a book with Steven Spears called Wiring the Winning Organisation.
If I&rsquo;m honest, I am not a fan of the title.

Dave Farley and Allen Holub are two people that I respect hugely when it comes to Software Development. I&rsquo;ve been following them on twitter for quite a while, and am always taken in about their takes on driving continuous delivery and &ldquo;lowercase agile&rdquo; forward. So when both came together for Dave&rsquo;s Engineering Room (sponsored by Equal Experts, who I work with), it was bound to be very interesting.
In this post I try to outline my key takeaways from watching the chat.

Dave Farley and Martin Fowler are two heavyweights when it comes to Software Development.

All of which are hugely influential to large swathes of software engineers. So when both came together for Dave&rsquo;s new series on YouTube, the Engineering Room (sponsored by Equal Experts), it was bound to be very interesting.

There&rsquo;s a metaphor about the fight between attackers and defenders in the Denial of Service cybersecurity game. It&rsquo;s an &ldquo;arms race&rdquo; between ever bigger attacks throwing huge amounts of traffic at ever more sophisticated defenses (e.g. AWS shield).
Incidentally, I&rsquo;ve just demonstrated an easy mistake: I&rsquo;m not describing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, it&rsquo;s a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The aim is to overwhelm the infrastructure, either the networking infrastructure or the application by sending more requests than can be handled.

The question of automatic dependency updates came up in our Slack channel the other day. There was a lot of nodding on how it is a good thing. Tools like Dependabot and Renovate were mentioned. Yet I was a dissenting voice. Why?
The case for automatic dependency updates is simple and seductive:
A bot would automatically scan your dependencies in your source code and create pull requests to update your libraries to the latest versions, sometimes even automatically merging it in.

From a security point of view, application logs are two-sided. On the one hand, it is really important to have good observability, to find out what is happening and what has happened. On the other hand, we don&rsquo;t want to leak sensitive information. In this post I am going to look at the kinds of things you might find in your logs. The juicy bits are Personal Identifying Information (PII) or security credentials.

From a security point of view, application logs are two-sided. On the one hand, it is really important to have good observability, to find out what is happening and what has happened. On the other hand, we don&rsquo;t want to leak sensitive information. In this post I am going to look at the kinds of things you might find in your logs. The juicy bits are Personal Identifying Information (PII) or security credentials.

Why AppSec fails

Let me tell you a story about Application Security (AppSec). It contains heroes and villains, and I&rsquo;m not necessarily thinking about the defenders and attackers here. It contains lots of interesting technology that is often overemphasised. We&rsquo;ve got whole industries that work on letting us know how scary it is out there, vulnerabilities that are marketed like rock stars and terminology that makes you quiver in your boots: who would want to fall victim to an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?

There&rsquo;s a metaphor about the fight between attackers and defenders in the Denial of Service cybersecurity game. It&rsquo;s an &ldquo;arms race&rdquo; between ever bigger attacks throwing huge amounts of traffic at ever more sophisticated defenses (e.g. AWS shield).
Incidentally, I&rsquo;ve just demonstrated an easy mistake: I&rsquo;m not describing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, it&rsquo;s a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The aim is to overwhelm the infrastructure, either the networking infrastructure or the application by sending more requests than can be handled.

In this post, I am going to look at an increasingly important part of securing applications: Your supply chain. This includes every library, tool or service that you are using to build, run and monitor your service.
When the log4shell vulnerability hit, it wasn&rsquo;t just a matter of looking at the dependencies that your source code pulls in, but also at the infrastructure you&rsquo;re using and the build pipeline.
Have you had a look at the vulnerability reports of your dependencies lately?

the decision by MongoDB to cut off services in Russia the destructive change in a node library that deleted files on Russian IPs a change in code/licence in a community terraform module to assert that Putin is a dickhead MongoDB cutting off Russian customers MongoDB is a company and in order to comply with sanctions they have decided to cut off Russian customers.

Pwnkit: How to exploit and check

Pwnkit is a vulnerability that uses a bug in polkit to elevate permissions to root. This write-up shows how to reproduce it using Ubuntu and what to do to check whether a system is vulnerable.
What went wrong? Quoting from the original researchers:
This vulnerability is an attacker&rsquo;s dream come true:
pkexec is installed by default on all major Linux distributions; pkexec is vulnerable since its creation, in May 2009; any unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability to obtain full root privileges; although this vulnerability is technically a memory corruption, it is exploitable instantly, reliably, in an architecture-independent way; and it is exploitable even if the polkit daemon itself is not running.

In this blog post, I would like to explore how missing input validation even in a trivial service can leave parts of server infrastructure crumbling.
In my opinion, this why securing applications (AppSec) is very difficult. Put supply chain attacks, unpatched systems and misconfiguring services to one side for a minute and consider that a lot of software is written by developers who do not necessarily consider all the edge cases or implications of what can go wrong even in the simplest of pieces of code (or just copy/paste from Stackoverflow).
