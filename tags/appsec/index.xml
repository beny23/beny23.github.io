It&amp;rsquo;s an &amp;ldquo;arms race&amp;rdquo; between ever bigger attacks throwing huge amounts of traffic at ever more sophisticated defenses (e.g. AWS shield).
Incidentally, I&amp;rsquo;ve just demonstrated an easy mistake: I&amp;rsquo;m not describing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, it&amp;rsquo;s a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The aim is to overwhelm the infrastructure, either the networking infrastructure or the application by sending more requests than can be handled.</description></item><item><title>Curating Dependency Vulnerabilities</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/curating_vulnerabilities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/curating_vulnerabilities/</guid><description>In this post, I am going to look at an increasingly important part of securing applications: Your supply chain. This includes every library, tool or service that you are using to build, run and monitor your service.
When the log4shell vulnerability hit, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a matter of looking at the dependencies that your source code pulls in, but also at the infrastructure you&amp;rsquo;re using and the build pipeline.
Have you had a look at the vulnerability reports of your dependencies lately?</description></item></channel></rss>
