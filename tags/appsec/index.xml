I happen to think that agile and application security go together rather well!
I had two different Slack conversations recently. One was on the UK cross-governmental #security Slack channel and the other one was on the Equal Experts #securit-ee Slack channel (yes I&amp;rsquo;m a consultant, and our Slack channels have hilariously got ee in their names).</description></item><item><title>BSides Newcastle 2023: Chaos for the future</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/bsides_ncl_2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/bsides_ncl_2023/</guid><description>After BSides Lancs and Leeds, Newcastle was my third BSides, both of the year and ever. I got up early in the morning for a road trip from Preston to Newcastle, and setting off at 5:30 on Saturday turned out to be atmospheric and straightforward. So I was a bit early and got a glimpse of the chaos that is putting together a BSides. Later I found out that BSides Newcastle was traditionally more chaotic than some of the other BSides.</description></item><item><title>The Case Against Automatic Dependency Updates</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/automatic_dependency_updates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/automatic_dependency_updates/</guid><description>The question of automatic dependency updates came up in our Slack channel the other day. There was a lot of nodding on how it is a good thing. Tools like Dependabot and Renovate were mentioned. Yet I was a dissenting voice. Why?
The case for automatic dependency updates is simple and seductive:
A bot would automatically scan your dependencies in your source code and create pull requests to update your libraries to the latest versions, sometimes even automatically merging it in.</description></item><item><title>Harvesting Logs for Fun and Profit</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/harvesting_logs_for_fun_and_profit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/harvesting_logs_for_fun_and_profit/</guid><description>From a security point of view, application logs are two-sided. On the one hand, it is really important to have good observability, to find out what is happening and what has happened. On the other hand, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to leak sensitive information. In this post I am going to look at the kinds of things you might find in your logs. The juicy bits are Personal Identifying Information (PII) or security credentials.</description></item><item><title>Why AppSec fails</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/why_appsec_fails/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/why_appsec_fails/</guid><description>Let me tell you a story about Application Security (AppSec). It contains heroes and villains, and I&amp;rsquo;m not necessarily thinking about the defenders and attackers here. It contains lots of interesting technology that is often overemphasised. We&amp;rsquo;ve got whole industries that work on letting us know how scary it is out there, vulnerabilities that are marketed like rock stars and terminology that makes you quiver in your boots: who would want to fall victim to an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?</description></item><item><title>Precision Munitions for Denial of Service</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/precision_munitions_for_denial_of_service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2023 23:48:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/precision_munitions_for_denial_of_service/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s a metaphor about the fight between attackers and defenders in the Denial of Service cybersecurity game. It&amp;rsquo;s an &amp;ldquo;arms race&amp;rdquo; between ever bigger attacks throwing huge amounts of traffic at ever more sophisticated defenses (e.g. AWS shield).
Incidentally, I&amp;rsquo;ve just demonstrated an easy mistake: I&amp;rsquo;m not describing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, it&amp;rsquo;s a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The aim is to overwhelm the infrastructure, either the networking infrastructure or the application by sending more requests than can be handled.</description></item><item><title>Curating Dependency Vulnerabilities</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/curating_vulnerabilities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/curating_vulnerabilities/</guid><description>In this post, I am going to look at an increasingly important part of securing applications: Your supply chain. This includes every library, tool or service that you are using to build, run and monitor your service.
When the log4shell vulnerability hit, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a matter of looking at the dependencies that your source code pulls in, but also at the infrastructure you&amp;rsquo;re using and the build pipeline.
Have you had a look at the vulnerability reports of your dependencies lately?</description></item></channel></rss>
