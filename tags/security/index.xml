This write-up shows how to reproduce it using Ubuntu and what to do to check whether a system is vulnerable.
What went wrong? Quoting from the original researchers:
This vulnerability is an attacker&amp;rsquo;s dream come true:
pkexec is installed by default on all major Linux distributions; pkexec is vulnerable since its creation, in May 2009; any unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability to obtain full root privileges; although this vulnerability is technically a memory corruption, it is exploitable instantly, reliably, in an architecture-independent way; and it is exploitable even if the polkit daemon itself is not running.</description></item><item><title>Exponential exploit: Why AppSec is hard</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/one_plus_one_is_crash/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 01:50:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/one_plus_one_is_crash/</guid><description>In this blog post, I would like to explore how missing input validation even in a trivial service can leave parts of server infrastructure crumbling.
In my opinion, this why securing applications (AppSec) is very difficult. Put supply chain attacks, unpatched systems and misconfiguring services to one side for a minute and consider that a lot of software is written by developers who do not necessarily consider all the edge cases or implications of what can go wrong even in the simplest of pieces of code (or just copy/paste from Stackoverflow).</description></item><item><title>Coerced to make Xerces think</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/coerced_to_make_xerces_think/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2018 23:45:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/coerced_to_make_xerces_think/</guid><description>More and more I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that XML is evil! This is the third part of my series on why, as a software engineer, it is very useful to think about the potentially dangerous combination of outdated libraries and XML.
I recently carried out a review of the dependency scanning results CVE-2012-0881:
Apache Xerces2 Java allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted message to an XML service, which triggers hash table collisions.</description></item><item><title>How I learned to stop worrying and love a vulnerability</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_a_vulnerability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2018 10:22:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_a_vulnerability/</guid><description>Security specialists. Arghhh! They&amp;rsquo;re all sitting in their &amp;lsquo;ivory tower&amp;rsquo; without anything better to do than to take a baseball bat to your hard work and tell you how you&amp;rsquo;ve not considered some obscure vulnerability CVE-142341231/4234 in a library that you didn&amp;rsquo;t even know existed. Not only that, there is definitely no way that you can deploy now, even when the product owner is breathing down your neck saying that nobody is going home until we&amp;rsquo;ve fixed this!</description></item><item><title>Hiding XXE in Spreadsheets</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/hiding_xxe_in_spreadsheets/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 12:24:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/hiding_xxe_in_spreadsheets/</guid><description>Recently I tried to poke holes in a service. I found myself laughing out loud. This was a vulnerability whereby modifying a SAML authentication while being rePOSTed via the browser allowed me to inject a malicious payload (see XML External Entity (XXE) Processing and XML External Entity (XXE) Prevention Cheat Sheet) that could be used to use up a service&amp;rsquo;s memory and CPU. Health checks and automatic service restarts would have healed the service but it still would have allowed an attacker to mount a Denial of Service attack without needing a lot of requests.</description></item><item><title>Laughing out loud - Malicious Reauthentication</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/laughing_out_loud_malicious_auth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 10:02:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/laughing_out_loud_malicious_auth/</guid><description>Background I had found a vulnerability that made it is possible to insert maliciously crafted XML into the SAML payload that a reauthentication application returned to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability came about due to the use of a out-of-date but still widely used library.
The service could have been made to consume a lot of CPU and memory causing it respond very slowly if at all.</description></item></channel></rss>
