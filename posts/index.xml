Over the last few days I have had a lot of fun with a padding oracle. But let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back:

And I post it on the company Slack, sometimes on LinkedIn and often on BlueSky or Mastodon. (I deleted my Twitter account a long time ago. No Nazi bar for me.)
And yet, I often forget all about the content. And because I closed my browser with 200ish open tabs once too often, I thought, why not write about the things that interested me, then I can look back on them and maybe someone else might find them interesting too.</description></item><item><title>BSides Newcastle 2025: Mission to Cyberspace</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/bsides_ncl_2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/bsides_ncl_2025/</guid><description>BSides Newcastle is probably one the most anarchic of the BSides I&amp;rsquo;ve been to so far. So much so that the fascists organised a protest. Well, not really, but there was a far-right and counter-protest not far from where the conference was. Thankfully, the organisers were on top of it and kept is all up-to-date with advice: &amp;ldquo;Punch Nazis&amp;rdquo; (for the benefit of the tape, nobody endorsed violence).
Aaanyway, aside from a really early start I was ready to dive in and hope to share some of the experiences with you.</description></item><item><title>Make it so: GenAI, OpenAPI and ZAP</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/make_it_so_genai_and_zap/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/make_it_so_genai_and_zap/</guid><description>Have you ever wondered how hard it is to make an AI talk to an API?

What made it that way? Was it the setting in the gorgeous looking Paastorni conference centre, was it the fact that the hotel was next door or was it because the speaker dinner the night before the conference set just about the right tone? Erm, of course that all helped, but I think it was the people.</description></item><item><title>From engineer to head of engineering</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/becoming_engineering_head/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/becoming_engineering_head/</guid><description>In January 2024, my comfortable tenure at Equal Experts came to an end and I went from 6 years of being a Java/Scala/AppSec consultant to being a head of engineering at a Middle Eastern fintech.

And communication. And agile. Let me start from the beginning. I&amp;rsquo;m sat on the train, coming back from Lean Agile Scotland 2024 and I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard, seen and done. The conference was great, and allowed for catching up with old and new friends, finding kindred spirits and having good food.

And I had been accepted to talk at SteelCon about AppSec and Agile and who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to drive over Snake Pass to cross into the wrong side of the Pennines. [Ducks].
Over the past year, I found myself going to quite a few community infosec events (I did the Northern BSides triathlon last year - Lancs, Leeds and Newcastle) and I feel like becoming part this family and have always felt really welcomed in this anarchic environment where leaf blowers and complaints desks take on special meanings.</description></item><item><title>Agile on the Beach 2024: Vulnerabilities are cool</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/aotb_2024/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/aotb_2024/</guid><description>After the fantastic experience of speaking at Agile on the Beach 2023 a year before, I was back for more agile. This meant more driving: again I took the motorway barge for the long road trip from the North West to almost the tip of the South West.

The organisers put out a jigsaw on a big table where attendees could mingle over searching through the 2000 pieces and chat at the same time. Such a great way of breaking the ice. And such a brilliant metaphor. A complex task is achieved through self organisation. Teams self-select and offer assistance all without intervention and imposed coordination or management.</description></item><item><title>XZ Backdoor: Not the End of Open Source</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/xz_backdoor_is_not_the_end_of_open_source/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/xz_backdoor_is_not_the_end_of_open_source/</guid><description>When I stumbled across a post that an encryption library offers a potential backdoor to SSH connectivity on Good Friday, my first thought was: why is it always on a Friday that these things drop?

Now let&amp;rsquo;s step back for a minute. Am I seriously suggesting that anything with the word &amp;ldquo;compliance&amp;rdquo; is going to be a riveting watch? Why, yes I am. And with good reason. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of good security and I like agile. And I think one of the major stumbling blocks about putting Sec into DevOps is to forget the agile origins of DevOps culture.</description></item><item><title>Victorification: Wiring the Winning Organisation Book Review</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/my_take_on_wiring_winning_org/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/my_take_on_wiring_winning_org/</guid><description>Last year was exciting, it was my first time going to a DevOps Enterprise Summit and meeting Gene Kim was very cool. The conference didn&amp;rsquo;t actually start on Tuesday, there was a little session on Monday as people were trickling in from all over the world.

I kept going with the phind-codellama model. I continued with keeping the model on a fairly tight leash and just being very specific as to what I wanted it to do.
What&amp;rsquo;s the puzzle? So, for the first part, we had to parse a text file and then match up numbers and winning numbers.</description></item><item><title>AI-dvent of Code 2023: Day 3</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_3_ai_experiments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_3_ai_experiments/</guid><description>My experimentation with LLMs on day 1 and day 2 of Advent of Code was a bit frustrating. For the day 3 puzzle, I decided to change model. Previously I had been using the codellama:13b model but wasn&amp;rsquo;t really happy. I kept arguing with it and it just frustrated me. So let&amp;rsquo;s try some others.

Yesterday I tried to get the LLM to develop the whole solution in one go. But that was more like argumentative programming rather than conversational programming, so for the day 2 puzzle I start with small problems and hope to put it all together at the end.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started The problem looked quite straightforward, parse something like the following</description></item><item><title>AI-dvent of Code 2023: Day 1</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_1_ai_experiments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_1_ai_experiments/</guid><description>So it is that time of the year again. Advent of Code is back. Yey! This means I get to try to look at a new language again. This time, why not Kotlin? But as an extra challenge, I thought why not see how the vaunted LLMs would help. Is AI really the accelerator that would elevate a mere developer to a rockstar ninja (whatever that is)?
I have to add that I am a bit of an AI sceptic and keep saying that</description></item><item><title>AppSec loves Agile</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/appsec_loves_agile/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/appsec_loves_agile/</guid><description>I describe myself as an Agile Fundamentalist because I really like the ideas of the Agile manifesto, and I also confidently state that I am an AppSec snooper, because in my day job I tend to look at other people&amp;rsquo;s code, logs and systems and break them.

I got up early in the morning for a road trip from Preston to Newcastle, and setting off at 5:30 on Saturday turned out to be atmospheric and straightforward. So I was a bit early and got a glimpse of the chaos that is putting together a BSides. Later I found out that BSides Newcastle was traditionally more chaotic than some of the other BSides.</description></item><item><title>44CON 2023: It takes a Village</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/44_con_2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/44_con_2023/</guid><description>As I stare at my laptop after an intense few days at 44CON, I reflect on the experience. I went through a lot of different emotions. Excitement, trepidation, relief, bewilderment, pride, disappointment and hope had accompanied my visit to London to 44CON. We had an OSINT Capture The Flag competition happen right next to a round-table discussion on how the government should secure the country. Looking from outside in, a rallying cry of &amp;ldquo;Hack the Planet&amp;rdquo; (if you want to feel old, it turned 28 during the con) side-by-side with the establishment might not be the first thing to expect at a security conference.</description></item><item><title>Leave the badge at the door</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/leave_the_badge_at_the_door/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/leave_the_badge_at_the_door/</guid><description>I am wearing my Equal Experts hoodie.

The case for automatic dependency updates is simple and seductive:
A bot would automatically scan your dependencies in your source code and create pull requests to update your libraries to the latest versions, sometimes even automatically merging it in.</description></item><item><title>Harvesting Logs for Fun and Profit</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/harvesting_logs_for_fun_and_profit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/harvesting_logs_for_fun_and_profit/</guid><description>From a security point of view, application logs are two-sided.

Thinking about exciting developments in software development as a developer immediately brings magpies to mind. What is the latest technology that can grab our attention. What&amp;rsquo;s the latest shiny? Could it be some crypto tech? Some no-code development? Or programming in the metaverse maybe?
No, no, and NO! Crypto is a scourge that wastes energy, kills the planet and destroys lives, no-code and low code will mean some actual software engineers will have to pick up the pieces when it inevitably will go wrong and the metaverse (second second life) looks to be a great way to make the web as tedious to use than going to an actual shop where you can&amp;rsquo;t find anything because the items have moved to another shelf yet again.</description></item><item><title>What do you think is the biggest challenge faced by the software product engineering community today?</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/agile_india_2022_speaker_interview_questions_2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 03:30:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/agile_india_2022_speaker_interview_questions_2/</guid><description>This is part of my series of interview questions for Agile India 2022.

pkexec is installed by default on all major Linux distributions; pkexec is vulnerable since its creation, in May 2009; any unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability to obtain full root privileges; although this vulnerability is technically a memory corruption, it is exploitable instantly, reliably, in an architecture-independent way; and it is exploitable even if the polkit daemon itself is not running.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin: When will the madness stop?</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/crypto_when_will_the_madness_stop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 01:19:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/crypto_when_will_the_madness_stop/</guid><description>In this writing I ask: When will this madness end?

Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be useful to record the session and make it available? Now, this piece of writing does not explore whether we should be recording meetings, nor does it attempt to answer the question of whether good documentation wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be preferable to having to sit and spend hours watching someone droning on about something that could be condensed into a five minute read of a blog post.</description></item><item><title>Fizzbuzz without if clauses</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/fizzbuzz_without_ifs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 08:44:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/fizzbuzz_without_ifs/</guid><description>In this writing I aim to complete a Fizzbuzz without if statements, conditionals, pattern matching or even using modulus calculations. And if that isn&amp;rsquo;t enough I thought I&amp;rsquo;d use the opportunity to explore Haskell.
The idea originated in the Friday lunchtime &amp;ldquo;Curry Club&amp;rdquo; at HMRC Digital where a few like-minded software engineers are getting together to teach themselves Haskell. (For those not in on the joke, the language is named after the logician Haskell Curry).</description></item><item><title>Exponential exploit: Why AppSec is hard</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/one_plus_one_is_crash/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 01:50:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/one_plus_one_is_crash/</guid><description>In this blog post, I would like to explore how missing input validation even in a trivial service can leave parts of server infrastructure crumbling.
In my opinion, this why securing applications (AppSec) is very difficult. Put supply chain attacks, unpatched systems and misconfiguring services to one side for a minute and consider that a lot of software is written by developers who do not necessarily consider all the edge cases or implications of what can go wrong even in the simplest of pieces of code (or just copy/paste from Stackoverflow).</description></item><item><title>Fixing Oracle DB Link Certificate Errors in RDS</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/rds_tcps_db_link/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 01:19:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/rds_tcps_db_link/</guid><description>After upgrading my AWS RDS instance from Oracle 11g Oracle 19c, my DB Link stopped working with a certificate error.

A good product owner, delivery manager or alike that will shield the engineers from having to attend too many meetings, giving long-winded status updates and essentially allow them to get on with it. Shields go to all the meetings with the &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; and explain what can and cannot be done, without the engineer having to attend. A shield would also filter all the last-minute requirements or requests for gold plating without having to be dragged into endless meetings.</description></item><item><title>Making Software.

Apache Xerces2 Java allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted message to an XML service, which triggers hash table collisions.</description></item><item><title>How I learned to stop worrying and love a vulnerability</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_a_vulnerability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2018 10:22:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_a_vulnerability/</guid><description>Security specialists.

I found myself laughing out loud. This was a vulnerability whereby modifying a SAML authentication while being rePOSTed via the browser allowed me to inject a malicious payload (see XML External Entity (XXE) Processing and XML External Entity (XXE) Prevention Cheat Sheet) that could be used to use up a service&amp;rsquo;s memory and CPU. Health checks and automatic service restarts would have healed the service but it still would have allowed an attacker to mount a Denial of Service attack without needing a lot of requests.</description></item><item><title>Laughing out loud - Malicious Reauthentication</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/laughing_out_loud_malicious_auth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 10:02:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/laughing_out_loud_malicious_auth/</guid><description>Background I had found a vulnerability that made it is possible to insert maliciously crafted XML into the SAML payload that a reauthentication application returned to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability came about due to the use of a out-of-date but still widely used library.
The service could have been made to consume a lot of CPU and memory causing it respond very slowly if at all.</description></item></channel></rss>
