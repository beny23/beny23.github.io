This is dystopian techno-fascism
Kevin posited a disconnect in Microsoft that led to the creation of this feature and whether people really wanted it.

The organisers put out a jigsaw on a big table where attendees could mingle over searching through the 2000 pieces and chat at the same time. Such a great way of breaking the ice. And such a brilliant metaphor. A complex task is achieved through self organisation. Teams self-select and offer assistance all without intervention and imposed coordination or management.</description></item><item><title>XZ Backdoor: Not the End of Open Source</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/xz_backdoor_is_not_the_end_of_open_source/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/xz_backdoor_is_not_the_end_of_open_source/</guid><description>When I stumbled across a post that an encryption library offers a potential backdoor to SSH connectivity on Good Friday, my first thought was: why is it always on a Friday that these things drop? And then my second one: oh bugger, here goes my weekend. Now, I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the technical details, there are many, many, many, many better resources out there, but I can&amp;rsquo;t help thinking that this would/should force the software industry to think.</description></item><item><title>Cyber Measures Up in Manchester</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/cyber_manchester_2024/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/cyber_manchester_2024/</guid><description>Peter Drucker said &amp;ldquo;What gets measured, gets managed&amp;rdquo;. When I turned up at Old Trafford, home of Manchester&amp;rsquo;s red team (it&amp;rsquo;s a security conference, geddit) for The Future of Cyber, I certainly was measurably impressed by the setting even though I&amp;rsquo;m usually found more on the blue spectrum of infosec.
But let&amp;rsquo;s get into the talks!
Measure, measure, measure First, Greg Notch talked about the importance of using metrics in communication.</description></item><item><title>Resisting compliance is futile</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/my_take_on_compliance_in_modern_dev/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/my_take_on_compliance_in_modern_dev/</guid><description>About two months ago I stumbled across a great YouTube video of a talk by Charity Majors called Compliance standards should be modern development practices. Now let&amp;rsquo;s step back for a minute. Am I seriously suggesting that anything with the word &amp;ldquo;compliance&amp;rdquo; is going to be a riveting watch? Why, yes I am. And with good reason. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of good security and I like agile. And I think one of the major stumbling blocks about putting Sec into DevOps is to forget the agile origins of DevOps culture.</description></item><item><title>Victorification: Wiring the Winning Organisation Book Review</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/my_take_on_wiring_winning_org/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/my_take_on_wiring_winning_org/</guid><description>Last year was exciting, it was my first time going to a DevOps Enterprise Summit and meeting Gene Kim was very cool. The conference didn&amp;rsquo;t actually start on Tuesday, there was a little session on Monday as people were trickling in from all over the world. And in said session, Gene presented his latest project. He was writing a book with Steven Spears called Wiring the Winning Organisation.

I kept going with the phind-codellama model. I continued with keeping the model on a fairly tight leash and just being very specific as to what I wanted it to do.
What&amp;rsquo;s the puzzle? So, for the first part, we had to parse a text file and then match up numbers and winning numbers.</description></item><item><title>AI-dvent of Code 2023: Day 3</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_3_ai_experiments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_3_ai_experiments/</guid><description>My experimentation with LLMs on day 1 and day 2 of Advent of Code was a bit frustrating. For the day 3 puzzle, I decided to change model. Previously I had been using the codellama:13b model but wasn&amp;rsquo;t really happy. I kept arguing with it and it just frustrated me. So let&amp;rsquo;s try some others.

Yesterday I tried to get the LLM to develop the whole solution in one go. But that was more like argumentative programming rather than conversational programming, so for the day 2 puzzle I start with small problems and hope to put it all together at the end.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started The problem looked quite straightforward, parse something like the following</description></item><item><title>AI-dvent of Code 2023: Day 1</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_1_ai_experiments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2023_day_1_ai_experiments/</guid><description>So it is that time of the year again. Advent of Code is back. Yey! This means I get to try to look at a new language again. This time, why not Kotlin? But as an extra challenge, I thought why not see how the vaunted LLMs would help. Is AI really the accelerator that would elevate a mere developer to a rockstar ninja (whatever that is)?
I have to add that I am a bit of an AI sceptic and keep saying that</description></item><item><title>AppSec loves Agile</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/appsec_loves_agile/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/appsec_loves_agile/</guid><description>I describe myself as an Agile Fundamentalist because I really like the ideas of the Agile manifesto, and I also confidently state that I am an AppSec snooper, because in my day job I tend to look at other people&amp;rsquo;s code, logs and systems and break them.

I had two different Slack conversations recently.

I got up early in the morning for a road trip from Preston to Newcastle, and setting off at 5:30 on Saturday turned out to be atmospheric and straightforward. So I was a bit early and got a glimpse of the chaos that is putting together a BSides. Later I found out that BSides Newcastle was traditionally more chaotic than some of the other BSides.</description></item><item><title>44CON 2023: It takes a Village</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/44_con_2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/44_con_2023/</guid><description>As I stare at my laptop after an intense few days at 44CON, I reflect on the experience. I went through a lot of different emotions. Excitement, trepidation, relief, bewilderment, pride, disappointment and hope had accompanied my visit to London to 44CON. We had an OSINT Capture The Flag competition happen right next to a round-table discussion on how the government should secure the country. Looking from outside in, a rallying cry of &amp;ldquo;Hack the Planet&amp;rdquo; (if you want to feel old, it turned 28 during the con) side-by-side with the establishment might not be the first thing to expect at a security conference.</description></item><item><title>Leave the badge at the door</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/leave_the_badge_at_the_door/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/leave_the_badge_at_the_door/</guid><description>I am wearing my Equal Experts hoodie. Often I&amp;rsquo;ll be found on conference calls with my EE t-shirts, and I even have some socks. So the irony of writing an article about &amp;ldquo;leaving the badge on the door&amp;rdquo; is not lost on me. So what do I mean?
Contracting Scum I am a contractor. I have been for the best part of 20 years. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in a variety of sectors (telecomms, finance, government) in a variety of roles (development, architecture, security) using a variety of methodologies (waterfall - eurgh, faux agile - double eurgh - and lowercase agile).</description></item><item><title>Agile on the Beach 2023: we're going to need a bigger boat</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/aotb_2023/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/aotb_2023/</guid><description>I am back at home, a few days after my first experience of Agile on the Beach. There were a few problems with it (yes, yes, I&amp;rsquo;m baiting you, I loved it). There was too much quality, it was really hard to pick which talks to go to. There was too much fun, it was difficult to leave the after-party after the beach party.

Now, if you&amp;rsquo;ve never been to a BSides - and I had only been to one prior - then hopefully this gives you a bit of a feel as to what to expect. In short, there&amp;rsquo;s lots of interesting people with great talks and insights and something that feels just right. A bit of community and some weird people.</description></item><item><title>Functional programming in MongoDB</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/functional_mongo_aggregation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 21:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/functional_mongo_aggregation/</guid><description>In this post I am looking at using the mongo aggregation pipeline in non-trivial ways. In fact, once I had done what I wanted to do I looked back at the result and discovered that a bit of an idea of functional programming helped me achieve what I wanted to do.

The DevOps Enterprise Summit 2023 has exceeded my expectations. But before I get to there, I&amp;rsquo;d just like to develop the airport metaphor a little bit. So here I am, looking at culture.
Why was it that at Schipol, one of the busiest airports in the world, it was a breeze to get through security, airport security agents were smiling, cracking jokes, I could leave my laptop, toothpaste and deodorant in the bag and they have art in the middle of the airport, goddammit.</description></item><item><title>DevOps Enterprise Summit - simple paper cranes</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/devops_enterprise_summit_2023_tuesday/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/devops_enterprise_summit_2023_tuesday/</guid><description>As I am sitting on the 16th floor of the Okura Hotel in Amsterdam in my Batman pyjamas and facing a large mirror, just glimpsing the paper crane that was so lovingly put on my pillow, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to reflect what has happened during the day.

There was a lot of nodding on how it is a good thing. Tools like Dependabot and Renovate were mentioned. Yet I was a dissenting voice. Why?
The case for automatic dependency updates is simple and seductive:
A bot would automatically scan your dependencies in your source code and create pull requests to update your libraries to the latest versions, sometimes even automatically merging it in.</description></item><item><title>Harvesting Logs for Fun and Profit</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/harvesting_logs_for_fun_and_profit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/harvesting_logs_for_fun_and_profit/</guid><description>From a security point of view, application logs are two-sided. On the one hand, it is really important to have good observability, to find out what is happening and what has happened. On the other hand, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to leak sensitive information. In this post I am going to look at the kinds of things you might find in your logs.

It contains heroes and villains, and I&amp;rsquo;m not necessarily thinking about the defenders and attackers here. It contains lots of interesting technology that is often overemphasised.

It&amp;rsquo;s an &amp;ldquo;arms race&amp;rdquo; between ever bigger attacks throwing huge amounts of traffic at ever more sophisticated defenses (e.g. AWS shield).
Incidentally, I&amp;rsquo;ve just demonstrated an easy mistake: I&amp;rsquo;m not describing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, it&amp;rsquo;s a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The aim is to overwhelm the infrastructure, either the networking infrastructure or the application by sending more requests than can be handled.</description></item><item><title>The agile power of saying no</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/notes_from_a_small_conference/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 17:30:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/notes_from_a_small_conference/</guid><description>I am sitting on the train as I type this coming back from my first IRL conference.

Thinking about exciting developments in software development as a developer immediately brings magpies to mind. What is the latest technology that can grab our attention. What&amp;rsquo;s the latest shiny? Could it be some crypto tech? Some no-code development? Or programming in the metaverse maybe?
No, no, and NO! Crypto is a scourge that wastes energy, kills the planet and destroys lives, no-code and low code will mean some actual software engineers will have to pick up the pieces when it inevitably will go wrong and the metaverse (second second life) looks to be a great way to make the web as tedious to use than going to an actual shop where you can&amp;rsquo;t find anything because the items have moved to another shelf yet again.</description></item><item><title>What do you think is the biggest challenge faced by the software product engineering community today?</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/agile_india_2022_speaker_interview_questions_2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 03:30:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/agile_india_2022_speaker_interview_questions_2/</guid><description>This is part of my series of interview questions for Agile India 2022.

I figured rather than a paragraph, the questions would make interesting blog posts:
I came to agile completely the wrong way.

This vulnerability is an attacker&amp;rsquo;s dream come true:
pkexec is installed by default on all major Linux distributions; pkexec is vulnerable since its creation, in May 2009; any unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability to obtain full root privileges; although this vulnerability is technically a memory corruption, it is exploitable instantly, reliably, in an architecture-independent way; and it is exploitable even if the polkit daemon itself is not running.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin: When will the madness stop?</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/crypto_when_will_the_madness_stop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 01:19:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/crypto_when_will_the_madness_stop/</guid><description>In this writing I ask: When will this madness end?

Health checks and automatic service restarts would have healed the service but it still would have allowed an attacker to mount a Denial of Service attack without needing a lot of requests.</description></item><item><title>Laughing out loud - Malicious Reauthentication</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/laughing_out_loud_malicious_auth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 10:02:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/laughing_out_loud_malicious_auth/</guid><description>Background I had found a vulnerability that made it is possible to insert maliciously crafted XML into the SAML payload that a reauthentication application returned to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability came about due to the use of a out-of-date but still widely used library.
The service could have been made to consume a lot of CPU and memory causing it respond very slowly if at all.</description></item></channel></rss>
