The platform in question is MDTP - Multichannel Digital Tax Platform, which supports a UK-based tax collection agency which is using a hyperscale cloud provider with a sideline in books.
I&amp;rsquo;ve previously described what it is like to work in MDTP (Making Software. Quickly) during the Covid-19 responses that allowed the UK government to provide financial support for millions turning around projects in record time.</description></item><item><title>On the weaponisation of open source</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/on_weaponisation_of_open_source/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 14:30:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/on_weaponisation_of_open_source/</guid><description>First of all I need the preface this article on how much I abhor the Russian invasion of Ukraine and I wholeheartedly support the sanctions. However, I think the conflict has spilled over into areas of software development that have got some unintended consequences attached.

the decision by MongoDB to cut off services in Russia the destructive change in a node library that deleted files on Russian IPs a change in code/licence in a community terraform module to assert that Putin is a dickhead MongoDB cutting off Russian customers MongoDB is a company and in order to comply with sanctions they have decided to cut off Russian customers.</description></item><item><title>What makes a good developer</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/what_makes_a_good_developer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2022 00:32:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/what_makes_a_good_developer/</guid><description>A few days back as part of a general discussion about interviewing at Equal Experts, we looked at the question &amp;ldquo;What makes a good developer?&amp;rdquo; Could we come up with a list of qualities in a developer that we&amp;rsquo;d want to look for? This post illustrates my thinking.
Why do you ask? To put it in a bit of context, I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer, I&amp;rsquo;m not a recruiter, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with technical interviewing for quite a while, and have marked a fair number of take-home tests over the years, but recently we thought that the experience was not as good as it could be.</description></item><item><title>Pwnkit: How to exploit and check</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/pwnkit_how_to_check_and_exploit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 21:34:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/pwnkit_how_to_check_and_exploit/</guid><description>Pwnkit is a vulnerability that uses a bug in polkit to elevate permissions to root. This write-up shows how to reproduce it using Ubuntu and what to do to check whether a system is vulnerable.
What went wrong? Quoting from the original researchers:
This vulnerability is an attacker&amp;rsquo;s dream come true:
pkexec is installed by default on all major Linux distributions; pkexec is vulnerable since its creation, in May 2009; any unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability to obtain full root privileges; although this vulnerability is technically a memory corruption, it is exploitable instantly, reliably, in an architecture-independent way; and it is exploitable even if the polkit daemon itself is not running.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin: When will the madness stop?</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/crypto_when_will_the_madness_stop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 01:19:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/crypto_when_will_the_madness_stop/</guid><description>In this writing I ask: When will this madness end?

The problem statement provided us with coordinates of cubes and an &amp;ldquo;on&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; instructions. These instructions needed to be carried out in order. The first part of the problem was deceptively simple. So much so that I didn&amp;rsquo;t go for the &amp;ldquo;obvious&amp;rdquo; solution initially because I thought it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t scale. As it happened I ended up implementing it anyway as my optimised approach wasn&amp;rsquo;t working because I made a simple mistake.</description></item><item><title>Advent of code 2021: Day 21</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_21/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 23:44:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_21/</guid><description>On Day 21 of Advent of Code 2021 we played Dirac Dice!

The problem The problem was described as follows.
Two players are playing a game with three dice Each starts on a different position of the board The board is circular and has 10 numbered positions Players take it in turn to roll three dice A player moves forward by the sum of those three dice Once the complete their move, they add as many points to their score as indicated by the board position First to 1000 points wins The dice are deterministic, meaning that they roll 1, 2, 3, &amp;hellip;, 100, 1, 2, &amp;hellip; Part One To start with, I created some types:</description></item><item><title>Advent of code 2021: Day 20</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_20/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 22:14:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_20/</guid><description>Hmpf. It&amp;rsquo;s now January and I&amp;rsquo;m still doing Advent. Still, I was determine to push ahead. Then I got stuck good and proper on Day 19 - though to be fair the whole Log4shell dumpster fire was taking up a lot of time, so I decided to skip it for now. Day 20 of Advent of Code 2021 was all about transforming images. What made it slightly more complicated was the fact that the images were nominally of infinite size.</description></item><item><title>Advent of code 2021: Day 18</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_18/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 02:14:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_18/</guid><description>Day 18 of Advent of Code 2021 took rather a long time to get right. Half of the problem was that there were a couple of gotchas in the requirements and the choice of data structure hugely impacted how easy it was to come up with a solution. Just like Day 17 I was using TDD and this helped me root out some blind alleys nicely.
The problem The story was roughly as follows: In order to continue on the Advent of Code submarine journey, we had to solve snailfish number problems.</description></item><item><title>Advent of code 2021: Day 17</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_17/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 17:14:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_17/</guid><description>On day 17 of Advent of Code 2021, I did something that I should have really done from the start: Write tests first. My excuse so far has been that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with Haskell yet and other such lame excuses. As a software engineer, I should know better. TDD doesn&amp;rsquo;t slow me down, it makes things faster. The last straw - if you like - was when I was writing up my exploits from Day 16 and I thought there really is no excuse for not testing these parser combinators individually.</description></item><item><title>Advent of code 2021: Day 16</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_16/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:14:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_16/</guid><description>For day 16 Advent of Code 2021, it was all about monadic parser combinators (whatever they are)! Just like Day 15, this one took me a lot longer to complete than I had wanted, this time it was all about learning Haskell&amp;rsquo;s approach to parsing text.
According to the story, we had to decode a message in a custom binary format, the Buoyancy Interchange Transmission System (BITS). BITS is a message format that encodes both literal values and operations.</description></item><item><title>Advent of code 2021: Day 15</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_15/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 17:28:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_15/</guid><description>Advent of Code 2021 day 15 took us back to the 2-dimensional maps we first encountered on Day 11 and Day 9. We had to parse a map again, and this time we had to find the shortest path from the top left to the bottom right. This was the first time when a homespun algorithm just did not cut the mustard, and I had to wrack my brain (i.e. use Google) to do a bit of algorithm research.</description></item><item><title>Advent of code 2021: Day 14</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_14/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 01:28:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_14/</guid><description>After Advent of Code 2021 transparent origami on Day 13 with more output than just a number, for Day 14 it was back to more standard processing with exponential complexity. Interestingly in part 1 I initially started going down the route of not trying to brute forcing it, got almost there but tangled myself in some logic, so I decided to &amp;ldquo;sod it, I&amp;rsquo;ll just brute force it&amp;rdquo; only to then throw the brute force solution away again as soon as I got to part 2.</description></item><item><title>Advent of code 2021: Day 13</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_13/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 01:15:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_13/</guid><description>On day 13 of Advent of Code 2021 we had to do the impossible. We were folding a transparent piece of paper 12 times. Surely it isn&amp;rsquo;t possible to fold paper more than 7 times, but we also have to remember that we&amp;rsquo;re in a Santa submarine!
The aim of the puzzle is to get a code by folding over a transparent sheet of paper which has got dots dotted all over.</description></item><item><title>Advent of code 2021: Day 12</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 00:11:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_12/</guid><description>For Advent of Code 2021 day 12 it took me a while to get going though for reasons unrelated to coding, Norovirus is not pleasant! So when I finally did the puzzle, I didn&amp;rsquo;t find it as difficult as I thought it would be based on some of the messages on the #adventofcode channel. The puzzle started with

In both cases, we got a 2-dimensional map with single digit values. In case of day 9 it was a height map, this time round we&amp;rsquo;ve got a 10x10 grid of bioluminescent Octopi. Each of those critters has an energy level that increases each round. Once that level goes past 9, it lets off a flash, which then imparts extra energy into the surrounding 8-legged creatures.</description></item><item><title>Advent of code 2021: Day 10</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_10/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 23:30:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/advent_of_code_2021_day_10/</guid><description>Day 10 of Advent of Code 2021 was all about mismatched brackets. And I think Haskell did rather well on this as I found the expressiveness arrived at a really concise solution. We&amp;rsquo;re still in our Advent submarine and after mapping the floor on Day 9, we now discover lots of syntax errors in the submarine navigation system.
The problem This puzzle was all about matching brackets, the input was like this:</description></item><item><title>Context and Lines - My Take on Engineering Room Ep 1</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/my_take_on_engineering_room_1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 16:30:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/my_take_on_engineering_room_1/</guid><description>Dave Farley and Martin Fowler are two heavyweights when it comes to Software Development.

It took longer to read the instructions than implementing the code. But then part 2 was back with a vengeance.

If anything I felt a touch suspicious on whether I had been missing anything. In previous days I had to reframe the problem statement a bit to make it efficient (Day 4, Day 5 and Day 5).

Apache Xerces2 Java allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted message to an XML service, which triggers hash table collisions.</description></item><item><title>How I learned to stop worrying and love a vulnerability</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_a_vulnerability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2018 10:22:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_a_vulnerability/</guid><description>Security specialists. Arghhh! They&amp;rsquo;re all sitting in their &amp;lsquo;ivory tower&amp;rsquo; without anything better to do than to take a baseball bat to your hard work and tell you how you&amp;rsquo;ve not considered some obscure vulnerability CVE-142341231/4234 in a library that you didn&amp;rsquo;t even know existed. Not only that, there is definitely no way that you can deploy now, even when the product owner is breathing down your neck saying that nobody is going home until we&amp;rsquo;ve fixed this!</description></item><item><title>Hiding XXE in Spreadsheets</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/hiding_xxe_in_spreadsheets/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 12:24:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/hiding_xxe_in_spreadsheets/</guid><description>Recently I tried to poke holes in a service. I found myself laughing out loud. This was a vulnerability whereby modifying a SAML authentication while being rePOSTed via the browser allowed me to inject a malicious payload (see XML External Entity (XXE) Processing and XML External Entity (XXE) Prevention Cheat Sheet) that could be used to use up a service&amp;rsquo;s memory and CPU. Health checks and automatic service restarts would have healed the service but it still would have allowed an attacker to mount a Denial of Service attack without needing a lot of requests.</description></item><item><title>Laughing out loud - Malicious Reauthentication</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/laughing_out_loud_malicious_auth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 10:02:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/laughing_out_loud_malicious_auth/</guid><description>Background I had found a vulnerability that made it is possible to insert maliciously crafted XML into the SAML payload that a reauthentication application returned to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability came about due to the use of a out-of-date but still widely used library.
The service could have been made to consume a lot of CPU and memory causing it respond very slowly if at all.</description></item></channel></rss>
